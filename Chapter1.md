## DEFINITION
### [What is PHP? ](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)
PHP is an acronym for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor. 
It is a popular scripting language. What on earth does that mean?
Well, don't think too much of the 'scripting'. Let's look at it this way:
say you want a child on an errand to assist you get something at the store. In order to ease her work and 
ensure your purchase is done accurately, you give a piece of paper with 
the items you want to purchase, this will help the child look at your list and 
make your purchase. When the child is done he/she returns with your item[s].
What happened was that the child made purchase on your behave from the local store, and
return your item[s] for you.
PHP can do same: take your instruction in a script(piece of paper), go 
to the server(local store) and return with a result.
Hope you're getting comfortable with PHP now. PHP is a straight forward 
language, easy to pickup and advanced enough to do cool stuff.
